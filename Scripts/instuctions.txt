Install SqLite extension in VSCode

Run the following commands within the commandline based on the location of the sqlite3.exe

Example:
Step 1: Create the database
C:\Temp\Coding\sqlite>sqlite3.exe ExotischNederland.db
Step 2: Read the script and apply it to the database
sqlite> .read C:\Temp\Coding\Zuyd_N_Tier\3-tier-architecture-demo\Scripts\ExotischNederlandDatabase.sql
Step 3: You should now have a .db file with your database name that you can use, in the same folder as the sqlite3.exe file
Step 4: Update the _connectionString accordingly within the InheemseSoortRepository
Step 5: Happy registering Inheemse soorten :)
